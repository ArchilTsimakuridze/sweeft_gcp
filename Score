# =============================================================================
REMARKS from Archil:

# when using branchPythonOperator you need actual branching in your dags. if true or false.
# you should move all your hardcoded access/password/urls to variables. in CF-s
# connections objects should have another function/class to get the connection.
# table can be created with columns.
# naming of folders in repo is confusing.
# you can use bashOperator but you don't need it. (lazy)
# composer dags shouldn't fail when there is no new data.
# json_formater, path_formater should be in same package of helpers.
# you should've used CRUD for your blob transfer not just upload from local.
# Repo State is bad, you should have at least two branches, one for development one for production/for me. and you should upload every code change to REPO. after some of the code is working you should merge it to master.
